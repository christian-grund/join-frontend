## About

Join frontend is a modern web application designed to help users efficiently organize and manage tasks. The goal is to enhance user-friendliness and make task management as intuitive as possible.

-   **Board with Categories**: A Kanban-style board with tasks organized into the categories 'To-Do', 'In Progress', 'Awaiting Feedback' and 'Done'. Tasks can be moved between categories using drag-and-drop.
-   **Contacts List**: A list of contacts with the ability to add, edit, and delete contacts.
-   **Backend**: Store and retrieve data from a backend storage.
